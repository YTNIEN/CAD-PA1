# 2017CAD PA1 - Reduction of Ordered Binary Decision Diagram

In this PA, students are asked to manipulate ROBDD and transform given input AIGs into
ITE format.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6.1 or higher
* No 3rd package used

## Code

* ROBDD.py

## Usage

```
python ROBDD.py <input1> <input2> <input3> <output>
```
1. Read AIGs from \<input1\> and \<input2\>, and construct corresponding ROBDD
2. Read a Boolean function of 'g' and 'h' from \<input3\>, and transform it into a vertex in ROBDD
3. Stream out all these three Boolean functions into \<output\>

Many thanks to TAs.
